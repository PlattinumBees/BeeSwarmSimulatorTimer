Note: Since this is a new file and is not widely known in the Google index, Google Chrome or other browsers may Warn that the program is uncommon or potentially malicious. I assure you it's not, but if you don't feel comfortable, you can use the "harder directions" below and run the script instead of the .exe.

Easiest Directions:

Download BeeSwarmSimulatorTimer_v#.exe
Open file and enjoy!
Harder Directions:

Download BeeSwarmSimulatorTimer.pyw python file
Install Python on your computer
Run the script using python.
Either directions will yield the same results, the choice is up to you.

Thanks,
The Plattinum Bee
